# The Conceptors

Hi there! Welcome to the Conceptors team github.
We're a group of friends who try together to expand and improve Minecraft's game aspects. We make our mods & projects with passion & love.


## About Our Projects:
Right now, we're focusing on finishing the following projects: 
- Energy Drinks - Auluna(Aulluna), Platinium(shitelessstatus)
- The Sculkening - Platinium(shitelessstatus)
- Biome Vote - Platinium(shitelessstatus)
- Recreation Of Waste Land - Clee(Cleeuwen05)
We're developing these mods on fabric but will eventually port them to forge & maintain them on both platforms once we get few things like our library ready.
## Contribution:
For the mean time, all of our projects repositories will remain private & our mods will be lisenced under ARR and will remain like that until it is safe to publish our mods source code & allow for public contirbution. So only close friends/devs can see & contribute. This is meant to keep our hard work safe from thiefs.
## Joining Our Team: 
We welcome people who are __skilled__ & willing to **commit** to our team. You might need to go through few tests to make sure you can join.
